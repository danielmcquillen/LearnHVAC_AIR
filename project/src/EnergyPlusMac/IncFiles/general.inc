!               Infiltration in perimeter zones only
!                            = 0.4 cfm/ft2 above grade wall area at 0.3 in wc (75 Pa) adjusted to 0.016 in wc (4 Pa).
!                              25% of full value when ventilation system on.
! HVAC:         VAV with reheat
!               Economizer per 90.1-2004
!
! Int. gains:   lights = 10.76 W/m2 (1.0 W/ft2);
