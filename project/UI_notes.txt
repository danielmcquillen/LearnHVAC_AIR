User Interface Notes
=============================================

Notes on the UI design and some of the conventions.

Input Panel
..............................................

The input panel is populated with all system variables with attribute type="INPUT"
The variables are arranged in separate lists, only one of which is shown at a time.
The current list showing is selected by a drop down.

The background of the input field for each variable in a list is white by default.
If the user changes the value, the background changes to yellow.
If the current value is outside the bounds set by the varibles low_value and high_value
properties, the box is shown with a red border and a red rollover warning flag.
