earn HVAC Client:
-----------------------
 
This project contains the Flex Builder code for the Learn HVAC desktop client. The client is an AIR application intended to work with the Learn HVAC server, which is a separate GIT project at the following URL
 
git@github.com:sergiobayona/learnhvac.git
 
The client can function by itself without a server connection by using the locally stored "scenarios."
 
Earlier instances of the LearnHVAC client were build in Flex and then wrapped with the Multidmedia Zinc program. This is no longer the case, as with the advent of AIR 2.0 all native process events are now performed through AIR. So, all that's needed to compile the project is Flex Builder 3 and the AIR 2.0 SDK. 

NOTE: Certain configuration files used by Flex Builder have not been checked into the git repository since they're specific to the user. So, the best way to load this project into your Flex Builder is to 

1. create a Flex Builder AIR project called LearnHVAC_AIR in a LearnHVAC_AIR/project folder. This will give you the basic configuration files (.flexProperties, .project, etc)
2. close Flex Builder
3. check out the contents of the git repository into that same folder structure
4. start Flex Builder and load the project (open one of the files into the edit window to make sure it's loaded)
5. open the project>properties window
6. select Flex Build Path and then the Library Path button on the top-right. Click "Add SWC folder" and navigate to the project's libs folder to get all the .swc's that are part of LearnHVAC on the compile path.

Note: there are some strange issues when compiling an AIR 2.0 application that uses native processes. More information will soon be available on the LearnHVAC site.
